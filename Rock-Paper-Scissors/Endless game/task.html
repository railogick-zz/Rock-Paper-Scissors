<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Actually, that was cool!</p>

<p>But it was really short nobody plays just a single game of rock-paper-scissors. We need to do some literally unstoppable game for unstoppable players. Not really unstoppable, implement a way to stop your program.</p>

<p>Improve your program so it wouldn't stop until the user enters <code>!exit</code>. After entering <code>!exit</code> the program should print <code>Bye!</code> and terminate. Optionally, you can add a <code>!help</code> command that helps the user to understand the rules, but it won't be tested.</p>

Well done. Computer chose scissors and failed
paper
Well done. Computer chose rock and failed
paper

!exit
Bye!</code></pre>
