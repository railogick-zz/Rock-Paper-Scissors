<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>People love to see their results as they're running to their goal.<br>
So, let's write a rating system:</p>

<p>When the game starts, the program should read ratings from a file named <code>rating.txt</code> and ask the user for the name.<br>
You can see the file format below. It's just name and a score divided by a single space.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Tim 350
Jane 200
Alex 400</code></pre>

<p>The program should print user rating when the user enters <code>!rating</code>. For example, if your rating is 0 then the program should print:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Your rating: 0</code></pre>

<p>Make it so for every game you add 50 points to the player for every draw and 100 for every win, and nothing for losing.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, the player should enter his/her name. Make sure that the name does not contain spaces! After that, the program should welcome the player and start playing with him.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>
